     Hands-On Project 01-05 : Debugging
      Work through the different sections listed
      and debug until working/displaying correctly.
   ~2 errors described and fixed in the first <script> regarding the variable reopenDate
   ~4 errors described and fixed regarding the message displayed using the <script> at bottom of page
    ~~ Instruction stated to put custom message, so took the liberty to make
       a slight change in the message while still using the created variable.

      <!--
   First error fixed was changing [] to () in the document.write()
   Second error fixed was changing Document to document
   Third error was correcting variable reopendate to reopenDate
   Fourth Error was changing // to */ at end of Create a custom message
    --Last error actually had me stumped for a bit!
    Made slight change like what is suggested for the reoppening message

   -->
      <script>
         /* Create a custom reopening message */
         document.write("<p>Sorry, We are closed for the holidays. We will reopen on " +reopenDate +". Thank You!</p>");
